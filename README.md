# history-travels

History Travels is a web application for a travel agency which is offering an immersive and hassle free experience of world heritage sites from the state of Tamil Nadu, India.

Home page invites user to explore the guided trail(s) available. User can add the places he/she want to visit and build a trail (aka Shopping cart functionality), add preferences via checkout form and finally place an order.

Backend:
Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Spring Security MySQL database (for users and orders - OneToMany Relationship)

Frontend:
Thymeleaf templating engine, Bootstrap, JavaScript.

Building it has given me good exposure of the Java, Spring Framework, Spring Boot MVC, Spring Security, Frontend aspects viz. component based UI, JavaScript, Shopping cart functionality, Browser Local storage etc.
