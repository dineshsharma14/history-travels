# history-travels

History Travels is a web application for a travel agency which is offering its users a immersive and hassle free experience of Indian 
history.

Home page shows what our website is for, invites user to explore the places and further we have the functionality of signing up and login.
To add the places one want to visit and build a trail, add preferences viz. type of hotel, food, car for local transportation and finally place a order on company.

I am developing this web application using Java SpringBoot, MySQL database (users), Bootstrap, Thymeleaf templating engine, HTML and CSS.

Building it has given me good exposure of the Java programming laguage, MVC system of development of applications using SpringBoot.
